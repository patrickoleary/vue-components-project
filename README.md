# AdvancedTransferFunctionEditor.vue - A Vue 3 Component

The `AdvancedTransferFunctionEditor.vue` is a sophisticated Vue 3 component designed for interactive creation and manipulation of 1D transfer functions and colormaps. It provides a rich user interface for defining how data values map to colors and opacities, commonly used in scientific visualization and data analysis applications.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this component is to offer a flexible and intuitive way to:
*   Define and visualize colormaps.
*   Create complex transfer functions using linear segments or Gaussian distributions.
*   Adjust the overall opacity of the transfer function.
*   Visualize an underlying data distribution via an optional histogram.
*   Provide a themable and responsive user interface.

## Core Editors & Interactivity

The component features two main interactive editor modes for defining the transfer function:

### 1. Linear Transfer Function Editor

The linear editor allows users to define a piecewise linear transfer function by adding, moving, and deleting control points directly on a canvas. Each point defines a data value and its corresponding opacity.

![Linear Transfer Function Editor](docs/images/linear-editor.png)

*   **Add Points:** Click on an empty area in the editor canvas.
*   **Move Points:** Drag existing points horizontally (to change data value) or vertically (to change opacity).
*   **Delete Points:** Right-click (or context-click) on a point.
*   The background displays the selected colormap blended with the opacity defined by the linear function.

### 2. Gaussian Transfer Function Editor

The Gaussian editor enables the creation of transfer functions by summing multiple Gaussian components. Each Gaussian is defined by its center (mean), height (amplitude), width (standard deviation), and bias.

*   **Add Gaussians:** Click on an empty area in the editor canvas to add a new Gaussian centered at the click location.
*   **Select Gaussian:** Click on a Gaussian to select it for editing.
*   **Move Gaussian:** Drag the peak control point (circle) of a selected Gaussian to change its center and height.
*   **Adjust Width:** Drag the horizontal square handles at the base of a selected Gaussian to change its width.
*   **Adjust Bias:** Drag the vertical triangle handles of a selected Gaussian to adjust its bias, affecting the curve's skewness.
*   **Delete Gaussian:** Right-click (or context-click) on a Gaussian's peak control point.

## Features

## Managing Colormaps

The `AdvancedTransferFunctionEditor` component loads its available colormaps from an external JSON file located at `src/assets/colormaps.json`. You can customize the available colormaps by editing this file.

### Colormap JSON Structure

The `colormaps.json` file should contain a JSON array of colormap objects. Each object in the array defines a single colormap and must have the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Your Colormap Name",
  "gradient": "css-linear-gradient-value"
}
```

*   **`name`**: (String) This is the human-readable name that will appear in the colormap selection dropdown in the component's UI.
*   **`gradient`**: (String) This is a valid CSS `linear-gradient()` string that defines the visual appearance of the colormap.
    *   Example: `"linear-gradient(to right, #ff0000, #00ff00, #0000ff)"` for a red-green-blue gradient.
    *   Example: `"linear-gradient(to right, rgb(255,0,0), rgb(0,255,0), rgb(0,0,255))"`
    *   You can use hex codes, RGB, RGBA, HSL, or HSLA values for the colors.

### Updating Available Colormaps

To add, remove, or modify the colormaps available in the component:

1.  **Locate the file**: Open `src/assets/colormaps.json` in your project.
2.  **Add a new colormap**:
    *   Append a new JSON object to the array, following the structure described above.
    *   Ensure your `name` is unique and descriptive.
    *   Provide a valid CSS `linear-gradient` string for the `gradient` property.
3.  **Modify an existing colormap**:
    *   Edit the `name` or `gradient` property of an existing colormap object in the array.
4.  **Remove a colormap**:
    *   Delete the corresponding JSON object from the array.
5.  **Save the file**: After making your changes, save `colormaps.json`.

The component will automatically pick up these changes the next time it loads (usually on a page refresh or if the component is re-mounted, depending on your development server's hot-reloading capabilities).

**Example `colormaps.json`:**

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Custom Rainbow",
    "gradient": "linear-gradient(to right, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet)"
  },
  {
    "name": "Viridis",
    "gradient": "linear-gradient(to right, #440154, #3b528b, #21908d, #5dc863, #fde725)"
  },
  {
    "name": "Grayscale",
    "gradient": "linear-gradient(to right, #000, #fff)"
  }
]
```


*   **Colormap Selection:**
    *   Choose from a predefined list of colormaps.
    *   Colormaps are loaded from an external `colormaps.json` file.
    *   The selected colormap is displayed as a gradient in the UI and applied to the transfer function editor.
*   **Min/Max Value Range:**
    *   Define the data range (`minValue`, `maxValue`) over which the transfer function is applied.
    *   Inputs for `minValue` and `maxValue` with validation (min < max).
    *   Reset button to revert to initial default min/max values.
*   **Transfer Function Modes:**
    *   Switch between 'Linear' and 'Gaussian' editor modes.
*   **Transfer Function Opacity:**
    *   Global opacity slider to control the overall opacity of the generated transfer function.
    *   Percentage display for current opacity.
*   **Histogram Display:**
    *   Toggle the visibility of an underlying data histogram.
    *   Select the color of the histogram.
    *   (Note: The component expects histogram data to be provided as a prop if this feature is to be fully utilized).
*   **Theming:**
    *   Supports light and dark themes, switchable via a toggle.
    *   Uses CSS custom properties for easy customization.
*   **Interactive Controls:**
    *   Color swatch for selecting a base background color for the editor area.
    *   Tooltips for all interactive UI elements for better usability.
*   **Responsive Design:**
    *   UI elements adjust to fit within the component's width.

## Configuration (Props)

The component can be configured through Vue props. While many settings have internal defaults, you can override them by passing these props:

*   **`initial-min-value-prop`**:
    *   Type: `Number` or `String`
    *   Default: `573.113`
    *   Description: Sets the initial minimum value of the data range. This value is also used by the component's reset functionality.
*   **`initial-max-value-prop`**:
    *   Type: `Number` or `String`
    *   Default: `886.808`
    *   Description: Sets the initial maximum value of the data range. This value is also used by the component's reset functionality.
*   **`initial-transfer-function-mode-prop`**:
    *   Type: `String` ('linear' or 'gaussian')
    *   Default: `'linear'`
    *   Description: Sets the initial transfer function editor mode. Accepts 'linear' or 'gaussian'. This value is validated by the component.
*   **`initial-theme-prop`**:
    *   Type: `String` ('light' or 'dark')
    *   Default: `'light'`
    *   Description: Sets the initial theme for the component. Accepts 'light' or 'dark'. This value is validated by the component.
*   **`histogram-data-prop`**:
    *   Type: `Array`
    *   Default: `[]` (empty array)
    *   Description: An array of numbers representing the histogram data. If this prop is provided with a non-empty array, the component will use this data for the histogram display and will skip its internal sample histogram generation. Example: `[10, 20, 50, 30, 15]`

### Example Usage of Props

You can pass these props to the `<AdvancedTransferFunctionEditor>` component from its parent like so:

```html
<template>
  <AdvancedTransferFunctionEditor
    :initial-min-value-prop="500" 
    :initial-max-value-prop="1000"
    :histogram-data-prop="[10, 25, 70, 40, 15]"
    initial-theme-prop="dark"
    initial-transfer-function-mode-prop="gaussian"
  />
</template>

<script>
import AdvancedTransferFunctionEditor from './components/AdvancedTransferFunctionEditor.vue';

export default {
  components: {
    AdvancedTransferFunctionEditor
  },
  data() {
    return {
      // Example: if your histogram data is dynamic and bound
      // myHistogramData: [10, 25, 70, 40, 15] 
    };
  }
};
</script>
```
**Note:** For props of type `String` (like `initial-color-swatch-value` if not bound to dynamic data), you can pass them without `v-bind`. For `Number`, `Array`, `Boolean` types, or when binding to a data property in your parent component, always use `v-bind` (or the shorthand `:`).

## Output API (Events & Data Access)

To get the resulting transfer function data from the component, you can:

1.  **Listen to Events:** The component should emit events when the transfer function changes.
    *   Example: `@update:transferFunction`
    *   Payload for Linear Mode: An array of points, e.g., `[{value: 573.113, opacity: 0.0}, {value: 700, opacity: 0.8}, {value: 886.808, opacity: 1.0}]`.
    *   Payload for Gaussian Mode: An array of Gaussian objects, e.g., `[{center: 600, height: 0.8, width: 50, bias: 0}, {center: 750, height: 0.5, width: 30, bias: 0.2}]`.

2.  **Access via `v-model` or Refs (if applicable):** Depending on the component's internal structure, you might use `v-model` on a prop that holds the combined transfer function or access computed properties via a template ref.

    *   **Recommended Output Structure (Combined Transfer Function):**
        A common requirement is a sampled version of the transfer function, often an array of `[value, opacity]` pairs or `[value, r, g, b, a]` across the `minValue` to `maxValue` range. The component should ideally provide this directly or through a method.

    *   **Example of a desired output for a sampled transfer function (e.g., 256 samples):**
      ```javascript
      // Array of [value, red, green, blue, alpha]
      // Alpha is derived from the editor, RGB from the colormap
      [
        [573.113, 0.267, 0.004, 0.329, 0.0], // Sample 1
        [574.345, 0.268, 0.005, 0.331, 0.01], // Sample 2
        // ...
        [886.808, 0.993, 0.906, 0.143, 1.0]  // Sample 256
      ]
      ```
      (The exact mechanism for retrieving this combined, sampled output needs to be clearly defined in the component's API, likely via an event or a get method.)
